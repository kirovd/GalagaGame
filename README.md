# Galaga Web Edition

## Project Overview
"Galaga Web Edition" is a tribute to the classic 1981 arcade game "Galaga." This project aims to recreate the excitement and challenge of the original fixed shooter game using modern web technologies. Players control a spaceship, dodging and shooting enemy spacecraft in a bid to achieve the highest score.

## Objectives
- To recreate the classic Galaga game experience in a web-based environment.
- To demonstrate the capabilities of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in game development.
- To provide an engaging and nostalgic gaming experience for players of all ages.
- To develop skills in game design and programming within the context of web technologies.

## How It Works
- **Player Interaction**: Players use keyboard inputs to control a spaceship at the bottom of the screen.
- **Game Mechanics**: The spaceship can move horizontally and shoot at the descending enemies.
- **Enemies**: Enemy ships appear in waves, each with unique movement patterns and attack strategies. Enemy Boss appears every 2000 points and attacks player.
- **Scoring**: Players earn points by destroying enemies. The game ends when the player is hit.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structures the game's canvas and UI elements.
- **CSS**: Provides styling to recreate the game's retro look and ensure responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the game logic, including player control, enemy behavior, scoring, and collision detection.

## Running the Game
- Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
- Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to start playing.
